## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ojas Baral! I'm studying Computer Science with a minor in Business at the University of Colorado Boulder. I also like to create hobby projects! Take a look at two of my favorites:
- One Take A Day
  - A social media application that allows users to post one sports opinion a day.
- Mini Git Clone
  - A mini git clone that uses various data structures that I learned throughout my data structures course.
